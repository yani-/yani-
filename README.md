# Open Source Tools for Everyone

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, I share free, open source projects aimed at making life easier for developers and tech enthusiasts. Follow along to get notified about new tools and updates.

## About Me

I'm passionate about building practical software solutions that anyone can use. This space is dedicated solely to open source contributions - I'm not available for hire. My focus is on quality, simplicity, and community collaboration.

## What to Expect

- **Regular Updates:** I release new projects and updates frequently.
- **Community-Driven:** Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome.
- **Useful Tools:** Each project is designed to solve common problems with practical, easy-to-use solutions.

## Featured Projects

- **[Drop and Read](https://github.com/yani-/dropnread):**  
  *A web-based tool that helps prepare source code for Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining multiple files into a single text file. Perfect for when you need to share your codebase with AI models like GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini.*

- **[Windows NFS Manager](https://github.com/yani-/windows-nfs-manager):**  
  *A simple GUI application for managing NFS drives on Windows. Mount, unmount, and monitor NFS shares with an intuitive interface - no command line needed.*

- **[Before After](https://github.com/yani-/beforeafter):**  
  *A browser-based tool for comparing and combining before/after images. No server needed, runs entirely in your browser.*

## Technologies

I primarily work with:

- **Languages:** PHP, JavaScript, Python, GoLang, C++

Feel free to explore the repositories to see how these technologies come together in my work.
